MonetDB: Sampling Feature Benchmark
===================================

MonetDB is a column-based database, with an excellent scalability, due to its architecture.

A MonetDB's interesting feature is the possibility of using a sample instead of a full table when executing a query.

Sampling is a statistical technique that uses a small portion of data to infer information about the population. Some benefits include reduction of cost and time to perform a research, with minimal loss of accuracy.

The objective of this project is to verify if MonetDB's sampling feature is faster than a multiple clusters' architecture using the traditional query mode.
